# Merge two Linked Lists
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
* The whiteboard was in collaboration with Jenn, Jason and Timea. The Whiteboard was solid and made the actual coding very easy. The only hurdle i had was joining the node itself instead of the values, which caused me to debug for about 20 minutes, but once i figured it out i felt relieved it was a tiny error on my part. I'm really starting to dig linked lists and i was scared to learn them all these years.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the single list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
