# Linked List Insertions
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
### Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

* .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
* .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node


## Challenge
