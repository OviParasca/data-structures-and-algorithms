# Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/OviParasca/data-structures-and-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/OviParasca/data-structures-and-algorithms)

<!-- Short summary or background information -->
* Write a function called ```find-maximum-value``` which takes binary tree as its only imput. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.
